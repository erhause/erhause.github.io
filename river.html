			In the summertime, I am a tour guide on the Wisconsin River. I spend my days on double decker tour boats giving tours to 100+ people (each time!). We make two stops, one at Witches Gulch and one at Stand Rock. I love my job and I love the river!

			<p style="font-size: 20px;">These are some of my favorite parts on the tour: </p>

			<dl>
				<dt style="font-size: 24px"><b>Witches Gulch</b></dt>
				<dd>Witches Gulch is our first shore landing. In my opinion, it is by far the most beautiful part of the Upper Dells Tour. 
				<br>
				Witches Gulch got it's name from 2 places; H.H. Bennett, a famous photographer in the 1800s and second, (my favorite reason) Indigenous folks who said it was haunted by evil spirits, serpants and witches! So cool!  </dd>
			</dl>
			<br>
			<dl>
				<dt style="font-size: 24px"><b>Stand Rock</b></dt>
				<dd>Stand Rock is our second shore landing of the tour. It is home to the famous cliff/rock formation, Stand Rock.
				<br> 
				Here, Henry Hamilton Bennett created one of the first stop motion pictures with his invention of the snapper (similar to what we would call the 'shutter'). H.H. Bennett proved his invention by making his son jump between two high cliffs, eventually getting a picture of him perfectly suspended in between the two. 
				<br>
				Nowadays, we give people the chance to 'recreate' the picture by having highly trained dogs jump between these two cliffs (that are only about 5 feet apart).</dd>
			</dl>
			<br>
			<dl>
				<dt style="font-size: 24px"><b>The Narrows</b></dt>
				<dd>The Narrows is exactly what it sounds like: a very narrow channel on the Wisconsin River. It is actually the most narrow part on the whole Wisconsin River, the smallest part coming in at only 52 ft wide. 
				<br>
				At one time, during the days of lumber raftsman, they used to send lumber rafts through this narrow channel, but because of the dangers, a new career was born: Standing River Pilots! We even have 'the first billboard' in the Wisconsin Dells carved into one of the rocks by the late Leroy Gates, one of the most famous standing river pilots.</dd>

			<br>
			<dl>
				<dt style="font-size: 24px"><b>Cold Water Canyon</b></dt>
				<dd>While not part of the regular Upper Dells Tour, Cold Water Canyon is used for our Ghost Boat Tours, and it is incredibly beautiful. 
				<br>
				While you can technically boat into CWC, you can also drive in from the backside, and it consists of an intricate slot canyon (much like Witches Gulch). They say CWC is one of the most haunted areas on The Wisconsin River, with many legends and tales that are associated with it.</dd>
