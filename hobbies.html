		<h2><b>Concerts</b></h2>
		<p style="font-size: 20px"> One of my favorite things to do is go to concerts! I like going to both big concerts, and small concerts; both are enjoyable in their own ways. My favorite 'big' concerts I've been to are Harry Styles (twice) and Noah Kahan. I also loved my smaller concerts for The Band Camino (twice). The next concert I have planned is for a duo called 'Penny and Sparrow' and I can't wait!</p>
		<h2><b>Watching Movies and Podcasts</b></h2>
		<p style="font-size: 20px">One of my favorite past times is watching/listening to movies and podcasts. My roommates and I are big fans of finding new movies to watch, and in any free time I have, you can catch me listening to a podccast. My favorite movies are Call Me by Your Name, Little Women, and Barbie. My favorite podcasts are Crime Junkie, The Broski Report, and The Bald and The Beautiful.  
		<h2><b>Fashion and Thrifting</b></h2>
		<p style="font-size: 20px">I love experimenting with fashion and thrifting my favorite pieces. I've been thrifting since middle school, and it's my favorite way to find unique clothes. Before I decided on my current major, I debated going into fashion design. While I don't think that major/career path is for me, fashion will always be something I experiment with in my free time!</p>
