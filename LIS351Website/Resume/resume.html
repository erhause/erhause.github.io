			<li style="font-size: 20px"><b>Digital Marketing Intern:</b><br>
			While I'm still in the midst of this internship, the experiences I've had thus far have taught me so much about digital marketing and online platforms. Throughout the semester, I have learned how to analyze numerous social media metrics such as engagement rates, reach, SEO, etc., from multiple different platforms like Google Analytics and Meta Business Suite. I've helped create short form content, posts, and stories, and learned how to refine these strategies. This internship has been a great introduction to the career I hope to do post grad!</li> 
			<li style="font-size: 20px"><b>Tour Guide:</b><br>
			Being a tour guide has been the best experience in both my personal life and professional life. I have built many skills, most notably, my oral communication. Similarly, my public speaking skills have greatly improved, and I now feel comfortabale talking in front of large groups of people (something I was never comfortable with before). Dells Boat Tours has given me the oppurtunity to speak and work with numerous people from various backgrounds and it's a job I will value for the rest of my life! </li>
			<li style="font-size: 20px;"><b>Consumer Behavior and Markeplace Studies Major</b><br>
			I came into college undecided, but am so grateful to have chosen the CBMS program. This major has allowed me to test the waters with many different career outlooks; anywhere from buying and merchandising to digital marketing. I have chosen to go the digital marketing/social media route, and the classes I've taken have taught me so much about consumer engagement, sourcing and development, and digital marketing stratgies!  </li>
